# CSV Output Fix - Structured Compliance Data

## Problem Identified
The `system_outputs_test_dataset.csv` file was showing "N/A" values for all compliance fields because the CSV generation script was not properly extracting the structured compliance data from the Lambda function responses.

## Root Cause
The Lambda function was correctly returning structured compliance data, but the CSV generation script had two issues:
1. **Nested Response Structure**: The Lambda response was nested as `result -> result -> compliance`, but the script was looking for `result -> compliance`
2. **Legal Citations Format**: The `legal_citations` field contained dictionary objects instead of strings, causing a TypeError when trying to join them

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Response Structure Parsing
Updated `extract_compliance_data()` function in `generate_csv_output.py`:
```python
# Before (incorrect)
compliance = result.get("compliance", {})

# After (correct)
lambda_result = result.get("result", {})
compliance = lambda_result.get("compliance", {})
```

### 2. Fixed Legal Citations Handling
Added proper handling for dictionary objects in legal citations:
```python
# Handle legal_citations which might be dictionaries
legal_citations = compliance.get("legal_citations", [])
if legal_citations and isinstance(legal_citations[0], dict):
    legal_citations_str = ", ".join([f"{cite.get('law', '')} ({cite.get('jurisdiction', '')})" for cite in legal_citations])
else:
    legal_citations_str = ", ".join(legal_citations)
```

## CSV Data Structure

The generated CSV now contains properly structured compliance analysis:

- **need_geo_logic**: Boolean indicating if geo-specific compliance logic is needed
- **jurisdictions**: Comma-separated list of affected jurisdictions (EU, US-CA, UK, etc.)
- **legal_citations**: Legal regulations cited (formatted as "LAW (JURISDICTION)")
- **data_categories**: Types of data being processed (cookies, personal data, age data, etc.)
- **lawful_basis**: Legal basis for data processing (consent, legitimate interest, etc.)
- **consent_required**: Boolean indicating if user consent is required
- **confidence**: Model's confidence score (0.0-1.0)

## Test Results Summary
- **Total tests**: 8
- **Successful tests**: 8
- **Success rate**: 100.0%
- **Average response time**: 2.981 seconds

## Files Modified
- `generate_csv_output.py`: Fixed compliance data extraction logic
- `system_outputs_test_dataset.csv`: Regenerated with proper structured data

## Next Steps
The CSV output is now ready for deliverables submission. The structured compliance data provides comprehensive analysis of each test case, showing:
- Which jurisdictions are affected
- What types of data are involved
- Legal requirements and citations
- Confidence levels in the analysis

This demonstrates the system's ability to provide detailed, actionable compliance insights for different software features across multiple jurisdictions.
