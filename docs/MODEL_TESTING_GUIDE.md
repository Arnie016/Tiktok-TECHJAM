# 🧪 Model Testing Guide

## 🎯 **What to Do After Fine-tuning Completes**

Once your training job finishes successfully, follow these steps to test your fine-tuned model:

## 📋 **Step 1: Check Training Status**

1. **Go to SageMaker Console**: AWS SageMaker → Training Jobs
2. **Find your job**: Look for `huggingface-pytorch-training-*`
3. **Check status**: Should show "Completed" ✅

## 🚀 **Step 2: Deploy the Model**

Run the deployment script to create a SageMaker endpoint:

```bash
cd /Users/hema/Desktop/bedrock/sagemaker-finetune
AWS_PROFILE=bedrock-561 AWS_REGION=us-west-2 python3 deploy_and_test.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Find the latest training job artifacts
- ✅ Deploy model as SageMaker endpoint
- ✅ Test with sample cases
- ✅ Show you the endpoint name

## 🧪 **Step 3: Test the Model**

### Option A: Use the Built-in Testing
The deployment script includes automatic testing with sample cases.

### Option B: Manual Testing
Run the simple test script:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=bedrock-561 AWS_REGION=us-west-2 python3 test_model.py
```

## 📊 **Expected Test Results**

Your model should generate responses like:

```json
{
  "compliance_flag": "Needs Geo-Compliance",
  "law": "Quebec Bill 3, An Act to better protect persons of full age",
  "reason": "This feature requires age verification for adult content access in Quebec, which is mandated by Bill 3."
}
```

## 🎯 **Test Cases to Try**

### 1. **Age Verification Feature**
- **Input**: Age verification for Quebec users
- **Expected**: "Needs Geo-Compliance" with Quebec Bill 3

### 2. **Content Moderation Dashboard**
- **Input**: Content moderation tools
- **Expected**: "Needs Geo-Compliance" with DSA

### 3. **Basic Feature (No Law Context)**
- **Input**: Simple feature without law context
- **Expected**: "Not Enough Information"

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### ✅ **Good Results**
- Valid JSON output format
- Correct compliance flag classification
- Law citations match the provided context
- Reasonable reasoning

### ⚠️ **Issues to Watch For**
- Invalid JSON format
- Wrong compliance flags
- Missing law citations
- Unreasonable reasoning

## 📈 **Performance Metrics**

Track these metrics:
- **JSON Format Accuracy**: % of valid JSON responses
- **Compliance Flag Accuracy**: % of correct classifications
- **Law Citation Accuracy**: % of correct law references
- **Response Time**: Average inference time

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### If Deployment Fails
1. Check IAM permissions for SageMaker
2. Verify the training job completed successfully
3. Check S3 bucket access

### If Testing Fails
1. Verify endpoint is running
2. Check endpoint name in test script
3. Review CloudWatch logs

### If Model Performance is Poor
1. Check training logs for issues
2. Verify data quality
3. Consider retraining with more data

## 🎉 **Success Criteria**

Your model is working well if:
- ✅ Generates valid JSON responses
- ✅ Correctly identifies compliance requirements
- ✅ Cites appropriate laws
- ✅ Provides reasonable explanations
- ✅ Handles edge cases gracefully

## 📞 **Next Steps After Testing**

1. **Integration**: Connect to your RAG pipeline
2. **Production**: Set up monitoring and scaling
3. **Iteration**: Collect feedback and retrain
4. **Documentation**: Update compliance procedures

---

**Testing Status**: Ready to test once training completes  
**Expected Duration**: 15-30 minutes for deployment and testing  
**Success Metric**: >80% accuracy on test cases
