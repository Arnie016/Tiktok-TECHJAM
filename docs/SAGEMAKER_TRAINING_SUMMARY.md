# SageMaker Fine-Tuning Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a geo-compliance LLM fine-tuning system using AWS SageMaker. The goal is to train a model that can flag software features requiring geo-specific compliance logic based on regulatory documents.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Pipeline
- **Source**: PDF documents containing regulatory information (DSA, GDPR, US laws, etc.)
- **Processing**: `pdf_to_jsonl_refined.py` extracts features and enriches with law context
- **Enrichment**: Amazon Kendra retrieves relevant law snippets for each feature
- **Output**: JSONL format with instruction/input/output pairs

### 2. Training Data Structure
```json
{
  "instruction": "Analyze the following software feature to determine its geo-compliance requirements...",
  "input": "Feature Name: Age Verification\nFeature Description: ...\nLaw Context (structured JSON): {...}",
  "output": "{\"compliance_flag\": \"Needs Geo-Compliance\", \"law\": \"DSA\", \"reason\": \"...\"}"
}
```

### 3. Model Configuration
- **Base Model**: `deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-8b-base`
- **Fine-tuning Method**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Target Modules**: All linear layers (`target_modules=["all"]`)
- **Prompt Format**: `### Instruction:\n{input}\n\n### Response:\n`

### 4. SageMaker Setup
- **Instance**: `ml.g5.2xlarge`
- **Region**: `us-west-2`
- **Framework**: PyTorch with Transformers
- **Training Script**: `sagemaker-finetune/scripts/train.py`

## Training Process

### Data Files
- **Training**: `s3://arnav-finetune-1756054916/data/train.jsonl`
- **Validation**: `s3://arnav-finetune-1756054916/data/validation.jsonl`
- **Output**: `s3://arnav-finetune-1756054916/output`

### Hyperparameters
- **Epochs**: 3
- **Learning Rate**: 5e-5
- **Max Length**: 512
- **LoRA Rank**: 8
- **LoRA Alpha**: 16

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. RAG-Enhanced Training
- Law context retrieved from Amazon Kendra
- Structured JSON format with metadata (title, citation, article, section, date, URI, page, source, snippet)
- Context-grounded output generation

### 2. Obligation Mining
- Automatic feature discovery from PDF text
- Pattern matching for compliance-related sentences
- Multi-jurisdictional law mapping

### 3. Quality Controls
- One law per example rule
- Cross-jurisdiction filtering
- Citation validation
- Balanced class distribution (~25-35% "Not Enough Information")

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- Model access token management
- LoRA target module compatibility
- AWS service quota management

## Expected Outcomes

After training, the model should:
1. **Analyze software features** and identify geo-compliance requirements
2. **Ground responses** in provided law context
3. **Generate structured outputs** with compliance flags, law citations, and reasoning
4. **Handle edge cases** by returning "Not Enough Information" when context is insufficient

## Deployment Strategy

Once training completes:
1. Model artifacts will be saved to S3
2. Can be deployed as a SageMaker endpoint
3. Integration with existing RAG pipeline for real-time compliance analysis
4. Support for batch processing of feature descriptions

## Monitoring and Evaluation

- Training logs available in SageMaker console
- Validation metrics during training
- Model performance on compliance classification task
- Output quality assessment for legal accuracy

## Next Steps

1. Monitor training progress in SageMaker console
2. Evaluate model performance on validation set
3. Deploy fine-tuned model for inference
4. Integrate with production compliance workflow
5. Iterate on data quality and model performance

## Technical Notes

- Uses causal language modeling approach
- Prompt tokens masked in loss calculation
- Glossary-enhanced instructions for better domain understanding
- Compatible with various model architectures through flexible LoRA configuration
