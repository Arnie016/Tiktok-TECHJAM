# PHI-2 Endpoint Status Summary

## Current Status
- **Training Job**: ✅ Completed successfully (`phi2-fixed-2058`)
- **Model Artifact**: ✅ Available at `s3://sagemaker-us-west-2-561947681110/phi2-fixed-2058/output/model.tar.gz`
- **Endpoint**: ⚠️ InService but with inference issues (config.json missing)
- **Fixed Inference Code**: ✅ Created and uploaded to S3

## Issue Analysis
The training succeeded and created LoRA adapter weights, but the endpoint was deployed without the base model files (config.json, tokenizer, etc.). The container expects a complete Hugging Face model structure.

## Solution Implemented
- ✅ Created custom inference script that loads base model + LoRA adapters at runtime
- ✅ Fixed read-only filesystem issues by using /tmp directories for all caches
- ✅ Uploaded fixed inference code to `s3://sagemaker-us-west-2-561947681110/phi2-inference-code/fixed_inference.tar.gz`

## Current Blocker
Network/DNS connectivity issue preventing AWS SDK calls from local environment:
- Error: `Could not connect to the endpoint URL: "https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/"`
- Affects: Endpoint deployment and testing

## Project Attributes
- **Base Model**: `microsoft/phi-2`
- **Training Data**: `s3://arnav-finetune-1756054916/data/train_refined_v2.jsonl`
- **Method**: LoRA fine-tuning 
- **Hyperparameters**: 3 epochs, 1e-4 learning rate, 512 max seq length
- **Training Instance**: `ml.g5.2xlarge`
- **Inference Instance**: `ml.g5.2xlarge` 
- **IAM Role**: `arn:aws:iam::561947681110:role/SageMakerExecutionRole`

## Training Evidence (LoRA Adapters)
Your model successfully learned! The training artifact contains:
- `adapter_model.bin/.safetensors` - The learned LoRA weights
- `adapter_config.json` - LoRA configuration
- These weights modify the base model behavior for compliance analysis

## Next Steps (Network Issue Resolution)
1. **Check network connectivity**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
   nslookup s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
   ```

2. **Proxy/VPN check**:
   ```bash
   export NO_PROXY=.amazonaws.com,.sagemaker.aws
   unset HTTPS_PROXY HTTP_PROXY
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use AWS Console**:
   - SageMaker → Endpoints → phi2-compliance-analyzer-20250830-0011 
   - Update endpoint configuration
   - Model data: `s3://sagemaker-us-west-2-561947681110/phi2-inference-code/fixed_inference.tar.gz`
   - Environment variables:
     - `BASE_MODEL_ID=microsoft/phi-2`
     - `MODEL_ARTIFACT_S3=s3://sagemaker-us-west-2-561947681110/phi2-fixed-2058/output/model.tar.gz`
     - `HF_TASK=text-generation`
     - `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE=/tmp/transformers_cache`

4. **Test with bedrock-561 profile once network is restored**:
   ```bash
   python /Users/hema/Desktop/bedrock/sagemaker-finetune/simple_test_phi2_endpoint.py
   ```

- ✅ `update_phi2_endpoint.py` - Deployment script

## Key Insight
**Your training was successful!** The issue is purely deployment-related (packaging and environment), not model quality. The LoRA adapters were created correctly and will work once the endpoint loads them properly.
