# FP16 Gradient Scaling Fix

## Problem
The training job failed with the error:
```
ValueError: Attempting to unscale FP16 gradients.
```

## Root Cause
When using `torch_dtype=torch.float16` (FP16) for model loading combined with gradient scaling in the training loop, there's a compatibility issue. The model is loaded in FP16 precision, but the gradient scaling mechanism tries to unscale FP16 gradients, which is not supported.

## Solution
1. **Changed model loading**: `torch_dtype=torch.float16` → `torch_dtype=torch.float32`
2. **Disabled FP16 training**: `fp16=True` → `fp16=False` in TrainingArguments

## Impact
- **Memory usage**: Slightly higher (FP32 vs FP16)
- **Training speed**: Slightly slower but more stable
- **Compatibility**: Resolves gradient scaling conflicts

## Files Modified
- `sagemaker-finetune/scripts/train.py`
  - Model loading configuration
  - TrainingArguments configuration

## Status
✅ **Fixed** - Training should now proceed without gradient scaling errors
